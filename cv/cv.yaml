    summary:
      - IB programme graduate. Self-taught polyglot programmer. Currently 1st-course ICT student in a university. Excited to design inerrant user-facing software.
    profile:
      - '**Passionate** for the craft and get excited by the premise of working on code in general, no matter the specific area and my level of familiarity with it. Excited to have figured out the intricacies of any (your) codebase.'
      - "**Communicative** and **direct**. Taught to express ideas precisely and clearly. Work best as a part of a team. Ready to discuss a topic until a conclusion is reached and ask about everything I don't understand."
      - "**Punctual** and **monochronic**. Everything will be done on time. Always honest when negotiating deadlines. Didn't miss a single deadline since middle school."
      - '**Meticulous**, but not perfectionist. I focus a lot on edgecases. I always ensure that business-critical processes will behave sanely even in the most bizzare usecases. I act in accordance with my priorities, prefering valuable work to unnecessary polish.'
      - '**Adaptive**. Due to having worked a lot in large codebases as a freelancer I am used to jumping into a new large project/technology from the get go. Little to no prior training required.'
