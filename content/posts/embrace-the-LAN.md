For a long time I did not appreciate the local network. Things were either publicly available on the global internet or on my specific machine. That's one of the reasons I chose to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it stored everything locally and that felt important to me. And then I set up my first WireGuard server[^1].

[^1]: I was since notified that this is called *homelabbing*. Cool!
