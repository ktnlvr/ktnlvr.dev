## What is `battleships`?

I'm bad at playing battleships. This is a game that involves a lot of strategy and thinking on the surface, but a lot of the time can be up to random chance, hence I don't find it fun. 

The calculator is intended to help me skip the insufferable times I have to play it by predicting the most optimal position to attack.
