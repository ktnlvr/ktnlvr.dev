## Preface

If you are a player loooking to play with me, skip to the only section of interest to you: [House Rules](#house-rules).

If you are looking at my game design skills, keep reading.

## What?

I have been playing TTRPGs as long as I remember myself, so designing my own system was a question of not *if* but *when*.

Having spent enough time in the shoes of DnD5e/Pathfinder 2 Warlocks, Barbarians and Sorcerers I decided to explore what else the world has to offer. My bane is that I often play with new players that have not explored the possibility space of role-playing game to any extent. Thus, fast onboarding is crucial.

EZD6 was love at first sight. The core advantages to me from *d20 roll-under + Vancian Magic + 50 years of cultural legacy* are as follows:

* **Small Hitpoints** Most things die fast and easy, including PCs (player characters). While 
* **No Leveling** Party is only as powerful as their items and profficiencies, the only way to enhance your characters is by doing what would be sensible. As far as I know, most tables rule with milestone[^what-is-milestone] leveling anyway, but this makes every upgrade althemore precious.
* **Universality** Roll `Nd6`, take highest or lowest, done. Most things are resolved like that. The only types of boosts one gain from their party members is rolling more dice, thereby increasing th chances of rolling a higher number.
* **No "Gaming The System"** The system is very small and relies heavily on player-to-dm trust. I think that said trust should de facto be on the table in any game, but the light weight ensures munchkins and minmaxers don't win over by a technicality.
* **No Mental Maths** I like maths problems and puzzles. I hate mental maths. Haven't met a single person that enjoys it, all the less the chance that they'll play in my game.

On the other hand, the system has it's issues.

* **No Numbers** 

## MDA Analysis

MDA[^mda] stands for Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics, a framework used for analyzing games in terms of how mechanics encourage players to act in a certain way to manifest an emotion.

Mechanically, the game has 3 constituents: checks, attacks and casts. 

The **checks** require the player to roll a d6. They roll an extra one for each boon and pick the highest or add extra dice for each bane and pick the lowest. A 6 always succeeds, a 1 always fails.

Usually, the boons and banes are distributed by the DM, hence the players don't really have control over this. However, the players can help eachother out by incuring a boon on someone else's roll if they have the skills. A scribe might help a warrior decypher a scroll. The ability to gift a bonus to another player *for free* intensifies cooperations and allows playres to collaborate better.

Players can alter the result of their rolls by getting contributing their karma. Karma can be used to boost any roll but a one. What's more interesting, is that players get karma by **failing rolls**. When a roll is failed, the character gets 1 karma point. This balancing mechanic is to me the most brilliant part of the design.

Karma points allow players with bad roll streaks to come back. Getting bad dice rolls can be viewed as punishment for playing the games. Compensatory mechanics like this give players some control over the inherent output[^output-randomness] randomness.

## Machinations Analysis

Machinations is a framework that focuses on describing a game as a combinations of feed-back loop and resource conversion processes.

However, the only process governed by rules that can be viewed as a resource transaction is raw combat, so this chapter will focus on the out-of-the-box combat mechanics.

The formal resources by rules of EZD6 are *Karma*, *Hero Die*, *Hitpoints* of the PCs and the Bag Guys, *Boons*/*Banes*.

## House Rules

### Blaze Of Glory

Upon death, a character may wish to do a final action, they are granted a maximum degree of success. If the action is casting a spell, they may cast any spell with the power level equal to their `karma + 1`.

Named after a similar rule in [Daggerheart](https://daggerheart.org/rules).
