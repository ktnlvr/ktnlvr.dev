## What?

Hello, world!

## Why your own version?

I have been playing TTRPGs as long as I remember myself, so designing my own system was a question of not *if* but *when*.

Having spent enough time in the shoes of DnD5e/Pathfinder 2 Warlocks, Barbarians and Sorcerers I decided to explore what else the world has to offer.
